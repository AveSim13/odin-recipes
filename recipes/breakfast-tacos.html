    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>These tacos were a college staple. Simple. Healthy. Filling. And quick to make. One of these will leave you wanting more.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2-4</strong> Eggs</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> Serrano Pepper (can sub jalapeno if you can't handle heat)</li>
        <li><strong>1/4</strong> Onion diced small</li>
        <li><strong>1-2</strong> Tomatoes diced</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> Bell Pepper diced</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> Garlic clove minced</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Corn Tortillas</li>
        <li>Salsa/hot sauce of choice</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop those aromatics (onion, garlic, chiles) and throw them into the fooping pan. Drizzle them with some olive oil to keep them company.</li>
        <li>I like to keep these to one pan, so push the veg to the top and start scrambling some eggs in the empty space. Once scrambled, combine with veg.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes (not a veg) and cook for about 2 minutes. Pan should be on low heat now. Season with salt.</li>
        <li>Crisp up some corn tortillas with a bit of oil in a small pan, and fill each with egg mixture. Top with sour ream and salsa and slam those babies into your eater.</li>
    </ol>
